# Object-Tracking-detection

First of all it must be clear that what is the difference between object detection and object tracking:

Object detection is the detection on every single frame and frame after frame.

Object tracking does frame-by-frame tracking but keeps the history of where the object is at a time after time

##We will talk first about object detection and then about how to apply object tracking to the detection.

# What are the possible applications?

The possible applications are different for example, counting how many people are in a certain area, checking how many objects pass on a conveyor belt, or counting the vehicles on a highway.

Surely where having seen the tutorial you will easily think of thousands of ideas applied to real-life or potentially to industry. Certainly, if you need to design a tri-section of objects this is the tool you need.

# What do we need?

In this tutorial we will use 3 files.:

1 The video of the highway we will use to count the vehicles

2 tracker files. This has already been written and you can simply download it

3 main file. Write me in real-time and we will proceed step by step with the integration of the libraries
